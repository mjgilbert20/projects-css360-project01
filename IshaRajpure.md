### Scenario 01: New e-Commerce Site

**Integration and Configuration** - This project is a good fit for the integration model because Perfect Apparel is requesting the product be developed by modifying their existing tools. Furthermore, the company is recruiting their experienced workers who have worked on these similar products and are familiar with the old products.

### Scenario 02: Dental Office Site

**Incremental** - The dentist has established their core and uncompromisable requirements as well as the possibility of future additions, thus this software can be developed incrementally. Also, they seem to be looking for just a product in hand initially, which doesn't have to be complete, so the incremental model will allow for new updates.

### Scenario 03: Nuclear Power Plant

**Waterfall** - The waterfall model is an appropriate choice for this product because the company is looking for a secure critical system that can last for a long time. And the enormity of this project requires multiple types of teams who will need to work with non-changing requirements.

### Scenario 04: Department of Transportation

**Integration and Configuration** - Your company will be creating software similar to your previous projects, so the integration and configuration model is applicable. With such a small team and little time to deliver, reusing old components from previous projects will be efficient, and because these components are owned by the company, you will have control over their evolution which will allow for more flexibility in this product.

### Scenario 05: Reducing Traffic

**Waterfall** - The waterfall model will be able to support the complexity and scale of this product. Also, because this is an embedded system, the company will have to thoroughly plan, and there will be multiple types of teams working this project, so writing detailed requirements early on is a necessity.

### Scenario 06: Educational Game

**Incremental & Agile** - Given the time crunch for the first release, it is ideal to follow to the incremental model. The company will be able to push out basic functionality early on for customers, and can continue releasing updates as the requirements evolve. The new updates will also give the marketing team continuous content for advertising, which will attract more customers. With the size of the team, it is recommended to follow the agile format to encourage speed and productivity.

### Scenario 07: Global Health

**Incremental** - The incremental model is best in this project because of the changing requirements: the team could be rewarded with more resources which will require them to redistribute resources and possibly expand the scope of the project. Also, to receive additional grants, the team must quickly produce a product for evaluation, so they will need start with just the basics.
