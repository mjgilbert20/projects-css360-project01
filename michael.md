# SDLC Analysis - Michael
For each of the following project proposals, a software development lifecycle (SDLC) model must be chosen with justification for this decision. There are a total of seven projects:
1. [New e-Commerce site](#e-commerce)

<a id="e-commerce"></a>
## 1. New e-Commerce site
> PerfectApparel wants to launch a new e-Commerce site to sell clothes, shoes, and accessories. The company
wants to provide an online shopping experience that will attract customers to come back to the site. For
example, customers may select their own colors, create their customized design, and quickly find matching
outfits.
>
> Today, PerfectApparel mainly uses in-house templates with its own custom scripting and extensions to create
web sites. An interpreter written in Java reads the templates and scripting and generates the appropriate web
page based on a customer’s request. Your management expects you to use same tools with minor
modifications to generate HTML5 pages and extensions needed for the new features.
>
>Your team consists of a combination of developers from your previous projects, new hires, and interns. You
will need to define requirements for any template or scripting extensions that you want and schedule their
development with a separate group that develops the Java interpreter and related software.

## 2. Dental office site
> Your good friend, a dentist, asks you to develop a web site for their new clinic. The web site should include
common information about the clinic like hours, location, dental staff, and downloadable forms. At some point
in the future, they would like to include an ability to make online appointments, send automated reminders via
text messages, and issue discounts. Your friend is flexible with the time when you will deliver software. They
also wish to continually add capabilities to the website in order to draw more patients to their clinic.

Incremental

## 3. Nuclear Power Plant
> You have been assigned to oversee the development of software that will monitor the status of a new nuclear
power plant. You have a group of scientists who can provide you with domain knowledge to help you design
the software.
> 
> Because of news of previous power plant failures, e.g., Three Mile Island and the more recent Fukushima-1
event in Japan, you want to make sure that the software you are designing will be robust, is able to deal with
hardware failure, and can fail safely. The software is expected to last for a long time (at least 10 years).
>
> The utility company who owns the power plant allows you to subcontract parts of the software development,
but you are ultimately responsible for the overall operation of the software.

Waterfall.

## 4. Department of Transportation
> Your company won the contract to develop a distributed application which stores data on the Cloud. This is in
response to a thorough 100 page specifications from the Department of Transportation. The specifications is
very detailed in what’s expected from the application.
> 
> Your company has developed similar solutions in the transportation domain on numerous previous occasions,
and you have the appropriate experienced staff for the project. You bid on the project to be completed within
18 months based on a team of 10 software engineers.

## 5. Reducing Traffic
> An experienced technology company hires you to manage a new project that incorporates distributed
computing and networking with car tracking equipment. The equipment will be used to monitor individual cars
(via GPS tracking devices) and general traffic (via sensors and cameras) in both surface streets and
freeways. Transportation officials should also be able to provide real-time traffic updates on digital billboards
along the roads.
>
> Your team has mainly created proprietary hardware/software solutions in the past. The team has substantially
skills in using object-oriented C++ to develop embedded systems.
Waterfall.

## 6. Educational Game
> You lead a small experienced team of 7 developers from a gaming company. Your team is responsible for
quickly developing educational games based on preliminary and evolving set of requirements. You have
internal and external customers who expect to use your games ASAP for their own testing efforts. You have a
team member who participates on educational conferences as well as acts a marketing representative to your
customers, the teachers and administrators at your local school district.

Incremental

## 7. Global Health
> You and your friends won a multi-million dollar grant from a foundation to develop software to address current
global challenges. Your startup company is also eligible to receive further grants if it can demonstrate
significant positive impact on the health of the people residing in developing countries.
> 
> Your whole company currently only has 5 people. You will need to hire team members as part of the
development effort. Your starting team consists of 2-3 developers who you know very well from previous
projects.
