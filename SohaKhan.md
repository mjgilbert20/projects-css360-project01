## 1. New e-Commerce site

**Chosen Model**: Integration & Configuration

**Justification**: An integration and configuration model would be best for this development due to the use of the previous technologies provided by the company for the basis. Customization to create those minor modifications needed is key for the project.

## 2. Dental Office site

**Chosen Model**: Incremental Model - Agile

**Justification**: The incremental agile model would be the best for this website development given the idea that continual capabilities are added over time without the limitations of time. Early releases are possible for feedback while not over-designing individual features for the website for simpler aspects such as automated messaging etc.

## 3. Nuclear Power Plant

**Chosen Model**: Waterfall

**Justification**: The waterfall model would be best suited for this development given the larger scale project. Requirements for this project need to be well defined in advance and tackling such risky requirements for prevention of impact on stakeholders is necessary. Critical reliability and safety requirements must be met and be in a complete state prior to deployment.

## 4. Department of Transportation

**Chosen Model**: Spiral

**Justification**: The spiral model would work best here given the larger scale of the project and tackling the riskiest requirements first is necessary when developing such transportation systems. Moreover, the company has familiarity with such work and will be working closely together in the process of development to mitigate risk and is a one end project for full release at completion.

## 5. Reducing Traffic

**Chosen Model**: Incremental

**Justification**: The incremental methodology would be best with its stepwise fashion and the ability to have feedback with early release of subsets. Feedback is necessary since the team does not have as much specific experience with networking projects and will require further observation. Large framework decisions and architecture should be made in advance.

## 6. Educational Game

**Chosen Model**: Incremental - agil

**Justification**: Incremental, agile methodology given quick turnaround without overdesigning and evolving set of requirements. Faster response time and less overhead with the delivery of the game being ongoing and requirements changing throughout the process.

<a id="global-health"></a>
## 7. Global Health

**Chosen Model**: Incremental 

**Justification**: 
Incremental development due to the fact that feedback from prototypes and early subsets of development to prove good use can result in further grants. Moreover, there is a smaller team base for the development
