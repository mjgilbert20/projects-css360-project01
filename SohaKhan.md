**Chosen Model**: Incremental Model - Agile

**Justification**: The incremental agile model would be the best for this website development given the idea that continual capabilities are added over time without the limitations of time.

## 3. Nuclear Power Plant

**Chosen Model**: Waterfall

**Justification**: The waterfall model would be best suited for this development given the larger scale project.

## 5. Reducing Traffic

**Chosen Model**: Incremental

**Justification**: The incremental methodology would be best with its stepwise fashion and the ability to have feedback with early release of subsets.
