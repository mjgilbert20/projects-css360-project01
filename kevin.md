**Individual SDLC Choices — Kevin Garcia**

# Project 1:  New e-Commerce site 

**Model:** Incremntal 

**Why?** The project has a lot of user facing features like custom colors, designs, outfit matching and it will need testing and be refined. this model method lets the team launch the basic online store first then add the features in stages and getting feedback in those stages.

# Project 2: Dental office site 

**Model:** Incremental  
**Why?** The clinic needs the basic website so hours, location, staff, forms but does want to add more features later and so incremetal works because we can deilver the basic website first then add the other features he wants over time

# Project 3: Nuclear Power Plant

**Model:** V-Model   
**Why?** This is a very important software so verifcation and vailddation has to be planned and documented and this model connects each requirment and design stage to matching tests which would help the reliabity and fail safe behavior. it also supports a long term maintenacne for a system expected to last 1o years and more 

# Project 4: Department of Transportation

**Model:** Waterfall  
**Why?** The dot provided a 100 page specfication so requirements are made upfront. And so waterfall fits because it documents and it has clear phases and planned delivery milestones. 

# Project 5: Reducing Traffic

**Model:** Spiral  
**Why?** This project is a high technical risk because it combines both hardware devices with distributed networking and also real ttime updates. So spiral is a good fit because it focuses on finding early risks and building prototypes and it reduces the chance of big failures during use..

# Project 6: Educational Game

**Model:** Agile (Scrum) 
**Why?** the requritments change and the customers want playable versions quick for testing which goes with sprint cycles. When you do scrum its frequent releases and you get quick feedback so the game improves quickly. This method also helps prioritize the most important features first

# Project 7: Global Health

**Model:** Incremental  
**Why?** since the startup is small and will be hiring during the development so the requirements and plans will change as the development goes and the team grows. And since Incremental development lets the teams deliver a minimum
